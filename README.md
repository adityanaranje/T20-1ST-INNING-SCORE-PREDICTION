# Project Title : T-20 CRICKET MATCH 1ST INNING'S SCORE PREDICTION
# Technologies : Machine Learning (Decision Tree)
# Domain : Sports


## Problem Statement:
* Nowadays lots of sports platforms like crickbuzz , espncrickinfo ,etc tries to predict the target which can be given by batting team based on their current score. Not only these platforms but also the batting and bowling teams tries to predict the projected score to create strategies based on it. In this type of case regression can be helpful. It can predict the score based on current and past conditions.


## Aim/Goal :
* To create an end to end api for prediction of T-20 cricket match's 1st inning's score using regression.

## Approach :
* Performs basic machine learning operations like data collection, data transformation , data cleaning, feature extraction, feature scaling , feature selection and model training on dataset. 

## Dataset
* The data set consists of yaml files for all T-20 matches. Get dataset from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/veeralakrishna/cricsheet-a-retrosheet-for-cricket)





## Tools Used:
  * Python 
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Sklearn
  * Flask
  * Pickle
  * HTML
  * Heroku




## Platforms Used:
*  Jupyter Notebook
*  VS Code
*  Github
*  Heroku


## What is regression?
* Regression analysis is a statistical method that helps us to analyze and understand the relationship between two or more variables of interest. The process that is adapted to perform regression analysis helps to understand which factors are important, which factors can be ignored, and how they are influencing each other.

* Regression consists of two main terms:
  * Dependent Variable: This is the variable that we are trying to understand or forecast/predict.
  * Independent Variable: These are factors that influence the analysis or target variable and provide us with information regarding the relationship of the variables with the target variable.

## What is Decision Tree?
* Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or more branches (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and Rainy), each representing values for the attribute tested. Leaf node (e.g., Hours Played) represents a decision on the numerical target. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.
